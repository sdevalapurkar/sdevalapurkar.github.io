Running the program
———————————————————

In order to get the program running, either:

1) run the makefile

or

2) assuming that already on the linux server:
- open a terminal window
- navigate to the directory where the files submitted are located using cd and ls
- once in the correct directory, type gcc -o -pthread MFS MFS.c in order to compile the MFS.c file
- to run MFS, type ./MFS followed by a filename (in this case flow.txt)
- the program is now running
